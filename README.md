# Hurricane-Harvey-Visualization
Using the PRISM Daily Spatial Climate AN81d dataset and the Google Earth Engine API to create a visualization of Hurricane Harvey, a natural disaster that hits close to home.

I was first introduced to the Google Earth Engine in my coding for social good lab and was fascinated by all of the potential data visualizations available. This summer, watching Hurrican Beryl come to Houston brought back memories of Hurricane Harvey. A terrible storm that ravaged my house and took the livelihoods of many Houstonians. I decided to use a precipitation dataset to code a visualization to show the magnitude and intensity of rainfall that Harvey brought for a week.
